"""
Where a project's run artifacts live.

Every run writes a workspace, a per-project wheelhouse, logs, outputs and an evidence
ledger under `data/runs/<project_id>/`. That path used to be spelled as a literal in
thirty-odd places, which meant the test suite wrote into the same directory the dev
server serves: tests left multi-gigabyte workspaces behind, and worse, a test could pass
on a directory an earlier run had created rather than on anything it set up itself.

Routing every caller through here gives the suite a single place to redirect (see
`tests/conftest.py`), exactly as `backend.app.db.set_db_path_override` does for the
database.
