"""
Deterministic diagnosis.

The repair loop used to depend entirely on the Solver choosing the right tool, confirming a
hypothesis and writing an exact patch within DIAGNOSE_STEPS_MAX steps. For faults the system
already classifies that is unnecessary and unreliable: the same benchmark passed on one run
and ran out of steps on the next, even though the evidence needed for the fix was recorded
in both. A missing module named in a traceback, or a configuration key that disagrees with a
value the paper states verbatim, is derivable from evidence rather than a matter of
judgement.

So those two cases are derived here, in code. Everything else still goes to the Solver.

This removes no safeguard. A patch produced here is an ordinary proposal: it carries real
evidence ids, and it still has to pass the policy engine, the Critic, and human approval
before it is applied. What it removes is the chance that a mechanical fix is missed because
the model took a different path.
