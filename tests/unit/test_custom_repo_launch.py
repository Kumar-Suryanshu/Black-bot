"""
Regression tests for launching a custom repository.

Adding https://github.com/greydanus/hamiltonian-nn triaged as FEASIBLE_WITH_PROVISIONING
but the launch button did nothing. Four separate defects combined:

1. The console pre-filled an invented command, "python train.py --config
   configs/default.yaml". HNN's entry points are experiment-*/train.py, so the server
   rejected it with 400 "Target script 'train.py' not found in workspace".
2. The console swallowed that 400, so the button looked inert.
3. README commands are written inline in backticks, which the extractor ignored, so there
   were no real candidates to offer instead.
4. HNN declares no dependencies at all, so no provisioning plan was ever built and the run
   could only ever die at `import torch`.
